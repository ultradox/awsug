              Hello fellow AWS Users! We'd like to remind you that on Tuesday, October 6th is our Monthly meetup!

              This month we will have a <a href="https://awssecworkshops.com/">security hands-on workshop about Access Delegation</a> (Level 200). We will learn how to use Amazon IAM to delegate access to services and promote the Principle of Least Privilege - giving users the minimum level of privilege they need to do their tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Build the environment using AWS CloudFormation</li>
              <li>Perform further customization on the environments to restrict the capabilities</li>
              <li>Test your customizations</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
              What you'll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your own AWS Account.</li>
              <li>Your own laptop and charger</li>
            </ul>
